It is planned and guided by an instructor and usually takes place in a face-to-face environment or through an online learning platform. These are types of training that need structure, have a time frame and a definite goal. <strong>Informal learning</strong> is at the other end of the spectrum. It is unstructured, often unintentional and takes place outside a conventional learning environment. Most importantly, it is self-directed and asynchronous.</p>",

Hybrid learning is a teaching method where teachers instruct in-person and remote students at the same time.

As online students have very different schedules, it is suggested that synchronous meetings be recorded such that students that cannot attend live can watch at a later time. \n Self and peer assessments can be used to reduce instructor workload, improve student learning experiences and build community. \n Look for opportunities to provide feedback to the entire class – i.e. an announcement or e-mail summarizing patterns observed in student assignments. \n Q & A discussion boards can also be useful to field common student questions.

Educators teach remote and in-person students at the same time using tools like video conferencing hardware and software. In some cases, hybrid classes include asynchronous learning elements, like online exercises and pre-recorded video instruction, to support face-to-face classroom sessions. When planned well, hybrid courses combine the best aspects of in-person and online learning while making education more attainable for many students. For hybrid learning to be successful, the elements of your hybrid course need to be tailored to the learning format, whether it be in-person or online.",

      "description": "<p>Action pedagogy is the conceptual basis of the Council of Europe's proposed Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) (2001 and 2008) which 'is action-oriented in that it considers language users and learners primarily as <i>social agents</i>, i.e. as members of society who have tasks (not exclusively language-related) to perform in a given set of circumstances, in a specific environment and within a particular field of action'. </p> <p>With regard to the performance of these tasks, the action approach takes into account the cognitive, emotional and volitional resources of the person, as well as the set of specific abilities that the person uses as a social agent. The action approach places great importance on the formulation of learning objectives.</p> <p>Indeed, action pedagogy is an approach to teaching that places the learner at the centre. It is rooted in socio-culturally mediated human agency and focuses on what teachers and learners do and say when engaged in meaningful teaching and learning activities.</p> <p><strong>Source:</strong><a href='https://www.bienenseigner.com/la-pedagogie-actionnelle/' target='_blank' style='color:#9F3DF5;  font-size:.975em'> La pédagogie actionnelle : définition, principes et exemples</a></p> ",

Many communicative activities, such as conversation and correspondence, are interactive, i.e. participants alternate as producers and receivers, often taking turns. In other cases, such as when speech is recorded or transmitted, or when texts are sent for publication, the senders are remote from the receivers, whom they may not even know and who cannot respond to them. In these cases the communicative act can be considered as the act of speaking, writing, listening or reading a text. In most cases, the user as speaker or author of a written text is producing his or her own text to express his or her own meanings. In others, he or she is acting as a channel of communication (often, but not necessarily, in different languages) between two or more people who for one reason or another cannot communicate directly. This process, called mediation, can be interactive or non-interactive. In the next level you will find more detailed information on the language strategies of comprehension, expression, interaction and mediation.",
