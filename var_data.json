Many communicative activities, such as conversation and correspondence, are interactive, i.e. participants alternate as producers and receivers, often taking turns. In other cases, such as when speech is recorded or transmitted, or when texts are sent for publication, the senders are remote from the receivers, whom they may not even know and who cannot respond to them. In these cases the communicative act can be considered as the act of speaking, writing, listening or reading a text. In most cases, the user as speaker or author of a written text is producing his or her own text to express his or her own meanings. In others, he or she is acting as a channel of communication (often, but not necessarily, in different languages) between two or more people who for one reason or another cannot communicate directly. This process, called mediation, can be interactive or non-interactive. In the next level you will find more detailed information on the language strategies of comprehension, expression, interaction and mediation.',
